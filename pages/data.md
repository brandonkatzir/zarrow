## Collection Metadata

Oklahoma State University is committed to upholding racial equality and celebrating diversity. We recognize that some of the language in this collection reflects a former time and period in history that is no longer acceptable according to present day standards and views. Artists' titles have been retained as a reflection of how our studies and understandings have progressed with time.

The table below provides sorting and basic search of the collection contents.
