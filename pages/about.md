## About the Collection

The OSU Library and OSU Museum of Art share the recent gift of the Maxine and Jack Zarrow Collection. This special selection of works will provide dynamic opportunities for OSU by advancing research resources, new exhibitions and interdisciplinary learning experiences.

This web portal features art from the couple’s work as collectors and provides insight into the method behind amassing such a collection.

Jack Zarrow was a native Tulsan; Maxine Foreman, originally from Texas, moved to Tulsa after her marriage to Jack in 1947. Both are graduates of the University of Texas at Austin.

After receiving his degree in petroleum engineering, Jack joined his father and brother at Sooner Pipe & Supply Corporation. During his business career, he served as Sooner’s executive vice president and president of all other Zarrow family enterprises.

Both Jack and Maxine served on a number of boards to support their community. Together the couple founded the Maxine & Jack Zarrow Family Foundation, which supports people with mental illness, physical or medical challenges and the homeless. The foundation is committed to transformational civic projects, especially efforts that seek to better engage those with limited access to our inspirational arts and cultural resources. Maxine and Jack built the foundation to perpetuate this meaningful work and continue the important Jewish tradition of tzedakah, or righteous behavior, for their children, grandchildren and future generations.

Jack passed away in 2012. Maxine resides in Tulsa.
